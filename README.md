![Introductory Picture](Cyclistic_Logo.png)
## Introduction
This project is a Case Study hosted by the Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate Program. In this case study, I take on the role of a marketing junior data analyst working for Cyclistic, a fictional bike sharing company located in Chicago, Illinois.

## Problem Statement
**Cyclstic's marketing strategy rely on building general awareness and appealing to broad customer segments.** One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

**Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are more profitable than casual riders.** Cyclistic's marketing director believe that the key to the company's future growth is by maximizing the number of annual members and that there is a good chance to convert casual riders into annual members. **The marketing team's goal is to design a marketing strategy aimed towards converting casual riders to annual members.**
